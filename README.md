## Things you have to plan way in advance (30+days)
- Nopa

## Places you shouldnt go unless you absolutely want to.
- 16th and mission bart stop
- Fishermans Wharf.
- Tenderloin

## General advice
- Never understimate the difficulty of having a car in San Francisco. It's almost always easier / cheaper to use Lyft, Muni, bikes, and/or BART to get around within the city than to pay for a rental car and parking. The city is also very pedestrian friendly, walking is usually the best option for trips of less than a mile or so.
